# Research Latex Template

This is just a basic template for making a research project. It includes `construction` for building latex/knitr documents and data, for storing data and setting up data analyses. Perhaps use R's [project-template](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/ProjectTemplate) to set up in this directory.
